## Why is it important

> Consumers search online before buying

- 92% of organic comes from google page 1 results

## Primary Traffic Sources

Google - Image / News
Youtube
Bing

Google Discovery - Mobile
Knowledge Graph
Google Weblite

## 4 steps under the hood

1. Crawl
2. Rank
3. Store
4. Display

> Number 1 stop gets 42% of clicks. Number 2 gets 11%.

It goes down exponentially. Page2/3 are generally not considered

## Basic guidelines

- Make pages primary for user, not for search engines
- Clear / deep / engaging content on website
- Unique valuable and engaging website
- Page speed is very important
- alt tag on images

> Decieving like duplicate content / stuffing keyword / link schemes / tricks doorway pages (funnel traffic to website) Hidden content (for ranking not users) are bad . Google can penalize these, and its hard to get back from this.

## Seo on page factors

- URLS
- Title tag and meta description -> CTR impacted
- Keywords for publisher sites ( news blogs etc)
- Headlines
- Header Tags h1 / h2 keywords and logical structure
- Image Optimization - alt tags, captions etc
- Interlinking
  - Anchor text - Should be write keyword for other page Eg Narendra Modi should be about Narendra modi
  - Link Volume - Not too many, not too less -> Should be relevantly spread
- Schema Markup - How page appears in google search (rich results) Movie poster / recipes etc
- NOfollow NoUGC etc

1. Title Tag: Contains keywords / Heading
2. H1 -> H2 -> H3 -> H4 -> First Second Third most important and so on
3. Alt tags are critical for images for google bot to understand
4. URLS - Domain + subdomain , should have clear keywords, user readable and shorter

> Google typically displays 50-60 characters of title and 150 ~ 160 characters of description rest is truncated

Though it is truncated for users, keywords are still read by bot.

## Keyword Strategy

> Identify trending topics from google trends, check what people are searching for and use appropriate content / keywords

Keywords are the target: To Target desired audience, target desired keywords

Page targeting running shoes : Title / H1 Should have running shoes. URL should contain running shoes

> Plan it right: Eg, target Logistics -> Too many use cases : Logistic case studies , logistics white papers, logistics FAQ, Logistics ROI -> Keyword cloud / cluster gives better results

Google trends should be used to check Keyword researches / Eg If consumer is looking for laptop : Brand Hp /Dell ? Price -> Under 35,000 ? Screen HD / FULL HD , This type of content generation and keywords along with competition analysis can give great results

Long tail keywords - Such as How to What is How to download e adhaar card etc, are specific and itnentional, can be fundamental for organic growth

> Online voice searches are increasing drastically
> Video traffic has increased drastically 2.5X

Google reports can be seen to identify trends

## Technical SEO

1. Robots.txt -> Block pages not meant to be crawled by bot
   X-Robots-tag
   Add No-Index tag
   Eg is thank you page in ecommerce which appears after purchase doesnt need to be crawled

2. SiteMap -> Directory of content available in site
   Image / Video sitemaps
   News Sitemaps
   can be multiple sitemaps, and maps based on content types

   Ping google when sitemap is updated http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=<>

   Links in sitemap should be available
   Add sitemap in robots file
   Submit sitemap in google search console

   No redirections
   No 404 /500
   No blank pages / thin content

   3. Mobile first indexing ->
      Google indexes mobile first, IF available, mobile is primary( changed from earlier)

      Google uses mobile first now

      - bot can access, render content
      - same content mweb, amp and desktop
      - use same meta robots tag on mobile and desktop
      - primary content shouldnt be lazy loaded
      - Clear meaningful headings
      - image urls should be same across platforms
      - structure data - same on mobile / desktop
      - follow mobile indexing checklist per google

Same content schema, images etc should be on mobile / desktop otherwise traffic loss

Crawl budget utilization:

> Crawl budget is the number of pages Google will crawl on your site on any given day. This number varies slightly from day to day, but overall, it's relatively stable. Google might crawl 6 pages on your site each day, it might crawl 5,000 pages, it might even crawl 4,000,000 pages every single day.

- [Crawl budget optimization](https://yoast.com/crawl-budget-optimization/)

Prioritize content googlebot must spend time crawling
Block pages not adding value to user
Block thin/ outdated content
Verify excluded pages in search console
Helps in faster crawling and indexing

> Only relevant and primary traffic pages should be allowed to be indexed to maintain a good crawl budget
> (via sitemap / etc)

Eg, if you have 2500 pages being crawled and 25 are updated, they might not reflect proeprly

## Structured data

- Increases CTR
- Improves search engine visibility
- shows up in knowledge graph / featured search

> impacts CTR , and not the ranking directly. However if CTR is reduced, ranking goes down
> JSON-LD format (Recommended)
> can be tested on [Rich Result tool](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)

Eg are

- Product schemas -> Ecommerce
- REview schemas -> gadgets
- Job
- Recipes -> TOI
- News Article -> Not shows up in top stories if not present
- Events
- Breadcrumbs
- Image Gallery
- Q&A

## Knowledge Panel:

> Appears on right on desktop displays results

## Geo Targeting

> Geo location is an important ranking factor - People searching in USA might need only relevant / interesting results. TOI implements different pages for the same

1. Link elements in head - hreflang = en , gb etc for different countries en-au. More important in companies like Expedia etc, where geo location is important ( tourism industry etc)
2. HTTP headers <loc> </loc> and sitemaps relevant to locations uk, aus etc
3. XML site tags

## Redirections

1. 301 -> Permanent , has new location
2. 302 -> Temporary eg product sold out

> Avoid redirect chains A->B->C is WRONG (Max value is 3, but should be avoided), https -> ensure Avoid tailing slash

Can be setup and seen on search console for errors.

## Speed

Low speed = High bounce rate ( inversely proportional and exponential)

## Web vitals

- LCP -> Largest contentful paint -> JS render slow times / CSS, Slow server response time Use caching , CDN etc
- FID -> First input delay -> When can user interact first with a site when a user first interacts with a page vs when page responds
- CLS -> Cumulative layout -> When page loads, the content can move which is a ranking factor ( also causes wrong clicks)

## PWA

> Deliver app like experience from mweb. Increased engagement, sessions etc

## AMP

Accelerted mobile pages - can have ads Prioritize what user wants on amp pages

Faster loads
Content loads first, then ads and images
Google optimizes the reading/ delivery of amp pages

## Vision:

Tech Innovation -> Mobile First-> Organic growth -> Engagement

Tech Load pages faster
Product: Content relevancy
Edit: Add appropriate content
Seo: Mark / highlight content appropriately
Business: Add revenue

Growth.

## Https checklist

- All http should be redirected to https via 307
- Hyperlinks / canonicals and all resources ( css js images) should be in https
- sitemaps / rss feeds -> https

Dont give HTTP links to bot.

## Discover google

- Personalized content in google mobile app and browser
- Can monitor performance in search console
- Comes on mobile browser/ has high CTR
- Location based ( More regional / language listing)
- Needs high quality images 1200px wide
- Appear only if:
  - Indexed by google
  - Meets google news content policy

## Key moments

- Creating specific time points of a video for better UX to user

## Web stories

More images, less text, feels like instagram / more social
can scroll through these

## Tools to use

Google tools
AMP validators

Google search console -> Fix bugs (Error count reduced) -> improve traffics

- Check website performance
- Find / resolve errors
- Check how googlebot reads page
- pagespeed usability issues
- submit sitemaps to google

AMP errors - super important , need to fix in real time, if fails impact is immediately known, page fails

URLS can be inspected in google web search tool

Bing webmaster tools can be used to do the same:

- Can control time to crawl ( control server load / crawl budget)

Data can be analysed with GA and Google Data Studios

- Podcast manager - google : can be used to understand working of podcast
- Rich results - for markup
- amp validator - for amp
- Lighthouse / Page speed - for page speed analyis

Webmaster can show data after 1 day / few hours, own tool can be created to scan seo daily,to catch errors , warnings etc
Alerting system - for robots / sitemaps etc can be created for proper monitoring
robots file monitor tool can be created

> Content behind a paywall can still be analysed with ldjson bots, should be utilized
